Welcome to the repository of my mini-project

ðŸš´ Ola Bike Ride Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning ðŸš´

This project is designed to predict ride demand patterns across Bangalore, leveraging machine learning to enhance urban mobility for both riders and Ola.

Project Overview:

Predicting ride demand can significantly improve ride availability, reduce wait times, and optimize resource management. This project uses historical data from 2022 to 2024 combined with real-time inputs like weather and calendar data to make accurate predictions for future ride demand.
Key Features and Highlights

1.	Smart Predictions:
o	Forecast ride demand based on key variables like time, place, weather, day status (holiday/working day), and temperature.
o	Integrated dynamic data sources to make the predictions adaptable to real-world scenarios.

2.	Powerful ML Model:
o	Built using LightGBM Regressor, a highly efficient boosting algorithm known for its speed and accuracy in handling large datasets.
o	Optimized model performance using hyperparameter tuning and evaluation metrics like RÂ² Score, RMSE, and Mean Absolute Error.

3.	Dynamic APIs:
o	Google Calendar API: Automatically determines if a selected date is a holiday or working day.
o	OpenWeather API: Fetches real-time temperature data for the chosen date, time, and location.

4.	Interactive Web Application:
o	A user-friendly interface built with Flask, styled using HTML and CSS, featuring an Ola-inspired theme for intuitive usability.
o	Allows users to input date, time, location, and dynamically fetch supporting data to predict ride demand instantly.

5.	Scalable Model:
o	Model saved and serialized using Joblib and Pickle, ensuring it is ready for deployment or integration into larger systems.

6.	Comprehensive Data Processing:
o	Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.
o	Features engineered to represent demand influencers such as trend (representing years) and day_status.

Technology Stack
â€¢	Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
â€¢	Machine Learning Workflow: 
  o	Data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling missing values.
  o	Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical data.
  o	Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
â€¢	Dynamic API Integration: Google Calendar and OpenWeather APIs for real-time data fetching.
â€¢	Web App Development: Flask for backend functionality and HTML/CSS for frontend design.

Impact of the Project
â€¢	For Riders: 
o	Plan smarter trips by understanding peak demand times and locations.
o	Ensure better ride availability and reduce wait times during busy hours.
â€¢	For Ola: 
o	Optimize driver allocation to meet demand more efficiently.
o	Improve user satisfaction by minimizing delays and overbooking.

Team Effort
